## Python F-Strings Check

### Directions

- Create a new folder on your workstation desktop named: **fstrings-check**
- Add a file (`fstrings_mc.py`) to the folder
- Add a comment block to the top of your Python file (name, date, *F-Strings Check* as the project title)  


### Finished?

- Bring your finished script up to your teacher during Teacher Time today


### Your Tasks

- Use a comment to label each task in your script
- For example: `# Task 1`, `# Task 2`, etc.
- Pay attention to spelling, grammar, and capitalization!

### Task 1
- Define two (2) string variables
- Define one (1) numeric variable
- Use an **f-string** to build and display a larger string that displays all four values


### Task 2

- Use the `print( )` function and an **f-string** three times to tell me what you've learned about f-strings in Python
- Assign each thing you've learned about f-strings to a separate variable
- Print each thing you've learned on a separate line


### Task 3

- Write a simple script that uses a CONSTANT named EXCHANGE_RATE to convert U.S. dollars to Euros
- Assume that one (1) U.S. dollar is equivalent to 0.90 Euros
- Prompt the user for their first name
- Use an f-string to welcome the user by first name to your conversion app
- Use a string method to display the user's first name in title case (first letter of their name is capitalized)
- Prompt the user to enter the number of U.S. dollars as a float
- Use f-strings to display (a) the number of U.S. dollars and (b) the equivalent number of Euros
